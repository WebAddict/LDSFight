				<p>To be faithful is to	hope for and act on	things which are not seen, which are true (see Alma	32:21).	In mortality, Jesus	Christ did all things by faith,	even performing	mighty miracles	such as	walking	on water.</p>
				<p>Jesus was only able to perform these	miracles by	excersising	his	own	faith in God.</p>
				<p>He asks us to exercise faith	in Him and His purposes	by trusting	Him	and	keeping	His	commandments.</p>

				<p>Faith leads to knowledge	and	understanding. President Boyd K. Packer, Acting	President of the Quorum	of the Twelve Apostles,	explained:</p>

				<p>“As you test	gospel principles by believing without knowing,	the	Spirit will	begin to teach you.	Gradually your faith will be replaced with knowledge.</p>

				<p>“You	will be	able to	discern, or	to see,	with spiritual eyes” (in Conference	Report,	Oct. 1994, 78; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 60).</p>

				<p>The missionary guide	Preach My Gospel explains the relationship between faith in	Jesus Christ and how we	live: “Faith leads to action, including	repentance,	obedience, and dedicated service. When you have	faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to	follow His commandments—even when you do not completely	understand the reasons for them. You accomplish	what the Lord wants	you	to accomplish. You help	bring about	good in	your own life and the lives	of others. You are able	to do miracles according to	the	Lord’s will. Your faith	will be	manifest through diligence and work” (Preach My	Gospel [2004], 116).</p>

				<h1>Faith precedes conversion.</h1>
				<p>Elder Richard G.	Scott of the Quorum	of the Twelve Apostles emphasized the importance of	faith: “The	need to	exercise faith in Jesus	Christ is absolutely essential.	It is the foundation of	the	plan of	salvation. When	that exercise of faith is coupled with sincere effort based	upon a willingness to hearken to His counsel, great	personal growth	and	blessings follow” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993,	119; or	Ensign,	Nov. 1993, 87–88).</p>
