		<div class="item item-body" style="">
<h1 class="pmfont">Do you ever miss days of a &quot;Spiritual Workout&quot;?</h1>

<p>1. Compare days where you haven't done anything to strenghen your spirit and draw closer to God, to days where you have... <strong>What is the difference?</strong></p>

<p>2. Accept this challenge to &quot;Workout&quot; spiritually every day for 7 days</p>

<p>3. You will proportionally get out of it to what you put into it. Don't do bare minimum. Push yourself!</p>

<p>4. Make a plan! Diversify what you learn. Spend time on multiple areas of spritual growth, just like you would if you were working out your body, focusing on different muscle groups, or endurance, or other training...</p>

<p>Here's an example plan:</p>

<p>Every Day: Wake up and read 15 mins Book of Mormon. Then listen to one Conference Talk. At night before bed, study one Preach My Gospel Lesson for 15 mins. Write down my feelings and experiences for today in my journal.</p>
<p>Also Every Day: Pray in the morning, before your all of your activities &amp; meals, and again before bed.</p>
<p>Also Every Day: Find TEN quick random acts of kindness to do for others</p>
<p>Saturday: Find a way to give service to someone in my ward for 30+ mins.</p>
<p>Sunday: Share my testimony with someone who needs it.</p>
<p>Testimonies don't have to be long, Micro-Testimonies are awesome! For example: "I had an amazing spiritual experience yesterday moving furniture for a neighbor! She was so grateful and the spirit was so strong! It really is true that serving others is like serving the Lord!"</p>
