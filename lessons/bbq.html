</div>
<h1>Is there going to be a Party at the End of the program?</h1>

<h1>How many points are there?</h1>
<p>There are over 30,000 total points before the BONUS and hidden points - In theory, there could be well over 40K points...</p>

<h1>How hard is it to get to 5K (5,000 points)?</h1>
<p>In only TWO Weeks, you could have:<br>
1,400 Scripture points<br>
about 2,000 Lesson points<br>
over 300 Fight Challenge points<br>
700 Journal points<br>
500 Duty to God points<br>
150 Scouting points<br>
1,000 Temple points<br>
200 Testimony points<br>
-----------------<br>
6,250 Points in 14 days, plus...</p>

<h1>Does claiming Rewards take away from my F.I.G.H.T. points?</h1>
<p>NO! Your SPENT points is kept track of seperately. You are encouraged to spend your hard earned points!</p>

<h1>Can I suggest a reward for the program?</h1>
<p>YES! We are interested in knowing what you would like! We will consider ALL reasonable requests!</p>

<p>YES! You can go back at any time and complete all of them! Just getting started? Just start with two-three lessons a day to get caught up!</p>

<h1>Does going to Mutal count towards Scouting?</h1>
<p>YES! If you spend 10+ mins on scouting, you can count it!</p>

<h1>Does going to 2nd Sunday Sundaes count towards Duty to God?</h1>
<p>YES! If you spend 10+ mins on Duty to God, you can count it!</p>

<h1>I don't have a Journal...</h1>
<p>There are so many ways to RECORD your feelings. A Journal doesn't have to be a book, but it should be something that can last for a long time and be something you read/review in a much later time of your life or pass on to your children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for an alternates to a "Book" style Journal:<br>
Email yourself! Write an email, just address it to yourself.<br>
Word Document or similar digital document saved to your computer<br>
Video / Audio Recordings - save them to a journal folder<br>
App! - there are hundreds of Journal/Note Apps<br>
<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 115%; color: #000000;">LDS Account</span> - Under 'My Account > Notes > Journal' - It is saved to your LDS account and will last FOREVER! *My personal favorite<br>
<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 115%; color: #000000;">Gospel Library App</span> - Under 'Notes > Journal' - It is saved to your LDS account and will last FOREVER! *My personal favorite</p>

<h1>Can I invite other's on the LDS Fight app?</h1>
<p>YES! Anyone can join the app! However only Deacons, Teachers and Priests from our Allen Ranch Ward can claim prizes and post things and leave comments.</p>
