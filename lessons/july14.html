<p>What choices are we making in this life?  Are we making choices that effect others positively or negatively.</p>

<p>I stopped by this week to talk to the Sults.  Russ (dad) was outside, he shook my hand and in tears told me how appreciative he was of US.  Of US, as in, all those that helped move on Saturday.  There was a large number of people there to help them move and the Sult's felt very loved.</p>

<p>I then went inside the house and there was Chad, Derek and Tammy (mom) packing up the remainder of their belongings.  Clearly overwhelmed by the task at hand, they expressed their gratitude for our ward.</p>

<p>It's opportunities like this that truly make us who we are.  Service to others shapes us into great men.  It helps us reach our potential and become as Heavenly Father desires us to be.</p>

<p>I can tell you I grew last Saturday as a person.  I grew because of you.  I grew because even though it was HOT outside, even though there seemed to be a never ending supply of boxes and things coming out of the house, even though, as we arrived at the storage unit, we were told the stuff went upstairs, no one complained.  I grew because of your examples of true discipleship.</p>


<p>I encourage you to always choose the better part.  Always try to think of others.  Know that true happiness comes when we serve other people.</p>

<p>As part of today's lesson, I challenge you to do 2 things:</p>
<p>1.  Do a random act of service for a family member.</p>
<p>2. Memorize one of the scriptures outlined in the F.I.G.H.T. program.</p>

<p>I can't tell you enough how amazed I am by each of you.  It is a HUGE blessing in my life to watch you learn and grow.</p>

<p>I hope we will each always F.I.G.H.T!!!!</p>
