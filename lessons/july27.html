<h3 class="pmfont">In retrospect, we should have had this lesson at the BEGINNING of the F.I.G.H.T. Program!</h3>

<p>In my youth, I had never really been a journal writer until I went on my mission... Then I was great at it for about 8 weeks! Then I kinda completely stopped for around 19 years...</p>

<p>Even when starting working on the F.I.G.H.T. Program, I was having some incredible experiences - and I didn't write them down. I have a terrible memory, so many of my amazing experiences will be lost... And I'm the one who will be missing them.</p>

<p>Around the 3rd week of our program, I decided to start writing more often. I got up to several journal entries per week. I started noticing that I was getting something out of it. I have started writing almost every day, and I'm impressed by what I'm able to get out of it.</p>

<p>I now understand that my perception on WHY you should write in a journal has been ALL WRONG! I thought you write in a journal for your kids, and grandkids... But I don't really have something to say to them, other than maybe some life-hacks...</p>

<p>In doing the F.I.G.H.T. program this summer, I have learned that the REAL reason you should write down your feelings - IS FOR YOU! The act of writing forces your brain to review - and in turn opens you up to seeing heavenly father's involvement in everything that you do. Here is my entry from last night.</p>

<h2>July 26, 2016</h2>
<p>My main database server went down at work today. It was accidentally destroyed by our hosting provider. On top of that the daily backup routine that they built for us turned out to be broken. They tried building a new server using a backup, but it was so old that it was completely unusable. At the three hour mark, they told us there was nothing they could do, and they were giving up on trying to fix it.</p>

<p>&quot;We're really sorry, but it shouldn't happen again.&quot;<p>

<p>This was obviously unacceptable for us. Each minute we are down costs me &amp; my company hundreds of dollars! We were UNWILLING to give up on recovering our data. If we just listened to them, we would have lost that data forever. But I FELT it was important for myself to investigate and find a way. I now realize that was a prompting from HF.</p>

<p>Normally I'd be furious, but I had a calmness over me as I worked on finding a way to save my company. I realized this was a time to rely on the Lord - and boy, did I! I said a prayer asking for help, and put on my Pandora 'LDS Hymns of Worship' station, and enjoyed a feeling a peace as I worked. I quickly found a 'broken' database backup from just one day ago, and was able to repair it, and put it on a brand new server. With some tweeking, we found the data to be usable and reliable. We only lost one day of data during the whole process. Also, because I have the system send me an email when certain things happen, we were able to rebuild a large portion of the missing data!</p>

<p>After an additional 6 hours of manually rebuilding the missing data, we relaunched the website after it had been down 10 hours.</p>

<p>I am so grateful for the feeling of peace I had as I worked. I know I was being watched over.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 50px;" class="pmfont">First Ponder: Have I seen the hand of God in my life today?</h1>

<p>As President Eyring said in the video "Trying to remember had allowed God to show me what he had done"</p>

<p>It has been a great strength to me to have to ponder, and to write! I would like to encourage all of you do try it out!</p>

<p>There are so many ways to RECORD your feelings. A Journal doesn't have to be a book, but it should be something that can last for a long time and be something you read/review in a much later time of your life or pass on to your children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Here are my favorite types of Journals:<br>
7. Word Document or similar digital document saved to your computer<br>
6. Email yourself! Write an email, just address it to yourself.<br>
5. Video / Audio Recordings - save them to a journal folder<br>
4. App! - there are hundreds of Journal/Note Apps<br>
3. <a href="https://jrnl.com/">jrnl.com</a> - a great online Journal<br>

		</div>
		<div class="item item-body" style="">

<p>Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been encouraged to keep a journal, diary or personal record for decades. The following list is a collection of quotes from general authorities on the topic of writing a personal history.</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">There is one subject I wish to speak upon and that is the keeping of a journal with respect to the dealings of God with us. … When the Prophet Joseph organized the Quorum of the Twelve, he counseled them to keep a history of their lives, and gave his reasons why they should do so. I have had this spirit and calling upon me since I first entered this church. I made a record from the first sermon I heard, and from that day until now I have kept a daily journal. Whenever I heard Joseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I always felt it my duty to write it; I felt uneasy and could not eat, drink, or sleep until I did write.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">Your journal is your autobiography, so it should be kept carefully. You are unique, and there may be incidents in your experience that are more noble and praiseworthy in their way than those recorded in any other life. There may be a flash of illumination here and a story of faithfulness there. … Your story should be written now while it is fresh and while the true details are available. … What could you do better for your children and your children’s children than to record the story of your life, your triumphs over adversity, your recovery after a fall, your progress when all seemed black, your rejoicing when you had finally achieved? Some of what you write may be humdrum dates and places, but there will also be rich passages that will be quoted by your posterity. … Get a notebook, a journal that will last through all time, and maybe the angels may quote from it for eternity. Begin today and write in it your going and comings, your deepest thoughts, your achievements, and your failures, your associations and your triumphs, your impressions and your testimonies. Remember, the Savior chastised those who failed to record important events. ... This is what the Lord has commanded and those who keep a personal journal are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance their daily lives.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">I urge all the people of this church to give serious attention to their family histories, to encourage their parents and grandparents to write their journals, and let no family go into eternity without having left their memoirs for their children, their grandchildren, and their posterity. This is a duty and a responsibility. ... Those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance in their daily lives. Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">People often use the excuse that their lives are uneventful and nobody would be interested in what they have done. But I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records, they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations. … Each of us is important to those who are near and dear to us – and as our posterity read of our life’s experiences, they, too, will come to know and love us. And in that glorious day when our families are together in the eternities, we will already be acquainted.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">As I view it, in every family a record should be kept. … That record should be the first stone, if you choose, in the family altar. It should be a book known and used in the family circle; and when the child reaches maturity and goes out to make another household, one of the first things that the young couple should take along should be the records of their families, to be extended by them as life goes on. … Each one of us carries, individually, the responsibility of record keeping, and we should assume it.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">Why is the writing of personal and family histories so important? There are many reasons. I will focus on just a few. ... By writing personal and family histories and doing the research required thereby, we inevitably have our hearts turned to our fathers as well as to our children. ... Also, by writing personal and family histories, we are helped immeasurably in gaining a true, eternal perspective of life. Writing our histories with the proper blend of fact and feeling (and so often, feelings in spiritual things are the real facts) gives us a deep spiritual insight into the meaning and purpose of our lives. ... Writing our histories will certainly help us keep our eyes on the most important of all goals — even the goal of eternal life. ... There is something eternal in the very nature of writing, as is so graphically illustrated by the scriptures themselves. In a very real sense, our properly written histories are a very important part of our family scripture and become a great source of spiritual strength to us and to our posterity. ... I have a strong feeling that when this life is over, our personal and family histories and the influence they wield will be of much greater importance than we now think.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">When our children were very small, I started to write down a few things about what happened every day. ... I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: 'Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?' As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior, Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance—even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God’s kindness. It will build our testimonies. You may not keep a journal. You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and serve. But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord has done. You remember that song we sometimes sing: “Count your many blessings; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="italic">I would like to share with you just a tiny sampling of the experiences I have had wherein prayers were heard and answered and which, in retrospect, brought blessings into my life as well as the lives of others. My daily journal, kept over all these years, has helped provide some specifics which I most likely would not otherwise be able to recount.</span>”</p>
