<p>The Bishop’s F.I.G.H.T. message this week focuses on “Father Day.”</p>

<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson said - A Father’s Work</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most essential of a father’s work is to turn the hearts of his children to their Heavenly Father.” —</p>

<p>Malachi 4:6 - Old Testament</p>

<p>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>

<p>For in God He Trust</p>
<p>As a Father &amp; Grandfather I Trust Heavenly Father's Plan - The Plan of Salvation!</p>

<p>I Ask Each of You to Visit with your Dad and ask him about How He Loves Being a Father and How much he Trusts God in Helping Him to Turn His Heart to you and to turn Your Heart to your Dad and Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Being a Righteous father takes a lot of work and requires much effort to FIGHT Satan and Keep Him at Bay from Influencing You.</p>

<p>Help your dad win this FIGHT!</p>
