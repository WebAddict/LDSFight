<p>I once read a quote that went something like this, don't let the success of others affect the goals you set in your own life. This lesson goes right along with that quote.</p>

<p>FOMO, or fear of missing out, is something that can change the way we live our lives. Elder Bednar teaches us that if we focus on what we are not doing or the fun others seem to be having, we can miss out on some great experiences in our own lives.</p>

<p>Elder Bednar invites us to trust in God and teaches that we will be blessed as we do so. True happiness is found when we follow this counsel.</p>

<p>Another point that he touches upon is not taking counsel from our fears. As I sat on the beach last week with my little family and some extended family, I began to think of all the time I have spent in the ocean since I was very young. I have grown to love the water and especially the waves of the shore. It is easy to fear being pummeled by the waves or getting bit by a shark. One is very likely to happen and the other is not. As some family members did not want to go very far out, they missed out on the fun that is riding the waves. So it is in life, if we take counsel from our fears, we will miss out on great experiences.</p>

<p>I know that as we choose to trust in God, it will become increasingly easier to choose the right. We are blessed with happiness when we do so. Fear ceases to exist as we truly put our faith in our Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>“Much has been said about how ‘fear of missing out’—or FOMO as it is often referred to—can make it difficult for us to appreciate our current circumstances and environments. This is especially true as people tend to share only the best parts of their family lives and careers with us on social media. I invite you to embrace what the Lord has blessed you with and to act in faith. Do not take counsel from your fears.</p>
<p>“To not take counsel from our fears simply means that we do not permit fear and uncertainty to determine our course in life, to affect negatively our attitudes and behavior, to influence improperly our important decisions, or to divert or distract us from all in this world that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report.</p>
<p>“To not take counsel from our fears means that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ overrules our fears and that we press forward with a steadfastness in Him.</p>
<p>“To not take counsel from our fears means that we trust in God’s guidance, assurance, and timing in our lives.</p>
<p>“I promise each of us can and will be blessed with direction, protection, and lasting joy as we learn to not take counsel from our fears.”</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</p>
