				<h1>Be Valiant in the Fight	of Faith</h1>
				<p>By Elder	Bruce R. McConkie in the October 1974 </p>
			</ion-item>

			<div class="item" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;">
				<iframe	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvuNSehXpEM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""	width="560"	height="315" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe>
			</div>
			<div class="item item-body">
				<p>From	the	pen	of Paul, we	take this challenge:</p>
				<p>“O man of God, …	follow after righteousness,	godliness, faith, love,	patience, meekness.</p>
				<p>“Fight the good fight of	faith, lay hold	on eternal life.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.11-12?lang=eng#10">1 Tim.	6:11–12</a>.)</p>
				<p>So wrote	our	fellow apostle to those	who	had	accepted the Son of	God	as their Savior, who had taken upon	themselves the yoke	of Christ, who had covenanted in the waters	of baptism to serve	him	and	keep his commandments. And so say we to	all	those today	who	have in	like manner	taken upon themselves the name of Christ and enlisted in the cause of truth	and	righteousness: Be valiant. Fight a good	fight. Stand true. Keep	the	commandments. Overcome the world.</p>
				<p>Speaking	of himself and the great warfare with the world	which he had won, Paul said:</p>
				<p>“I have fought a	good fight,	I have finished	my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
				<p>“Henceforth there is	laid up	for	me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall	give me	at that	day: and not to	me only, but unto all them also	that love his appearing.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.7-8?lang=eng#6">2	Tim. 4:7–8</a>.)</p>
				<p>As members of the Church, we	are	engaged	in a mighty	conflict. We are at	war. We	have enlisted in the cause of Christ to	fight against Lucifer and all that is lustful and carnal and evil in the world.	We have	sworn to fight alongside our friends and against our enemies, and we must not be confused in distinguishing	friends	from foes. As another of our ancient fellow	apostles wrote:	“Know ye not that the friendship of	the	world is enmity	with God? whosoever	therefore will be a	friend of the world	is the enemy of	God.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/4.4?lang=eng#3">James 4:4</a>.)</p>
				<p>The great war that rages	on every side and which	unfortunately is resulting in many casualties, some	fatal, is no new thing.	There was war even in heaven, when the forces of evil sought to	destroy	the	agency of man, and when	Lucifer	sought to lead us away from	the	path of	progression	and	advancement	established	by an all-wise Father.</p>
				<p>That	war	is continuing on earth,	and	the	devil is still wroth with the Church and goes forth	“to	make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have	the	testimony of Jesus Christ.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/12.17?lang=eng#16">Rev.	12:17</a>.)</p>
				<p>And it is now as	it has always been.	The	Saints can only	overcome him and his forces	“by	the	blood of the Lamb, … by	the	word of	their testimony,” and if they love “not	their lives	unto the death.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/12.11?lang=eng#10">Rev. 12:11</a>.)</p>
				<p>Now there neither are nor can be	any	neutrals in	this war. Every	member of the Church is	on one side	or the other. The soldiers who fight in	its	battles	will either, with Paul,	come off victorious	and	win	“a crown of	righteousness,”	or they	shall, in Paul’s language, “be punished	with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,	and	from the glory of his power” in	that day when he comes to take “vengeance on them that know	not	God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus	Christ.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-thes/1.9,8?lang=eng#8">2	Thes. 1:9, 8</a>.)</p>
				<p>In this war all who do not stand	forth courageously and valiantly are by	that fact alone	aiding the cause of	the	enemy. “They who are not for me	are	against	me,	saith our God.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.16?lang=eng#15">2	Ne.	10:16</a>.)</p>
				<p>We are either for the Church	or we are against it. We either	take its part or we	take the consequences. We cannot survive spiritually with one foot in the Church and the other in the world. We	must make the choice. It is	either the Church or the world.	There is no	middle ground. And the Lord	loves a	courageous man who fights openly and boldly	in his army.</p>
				<p>To certain members of his ancient church, he	said:</p>
				<p>“I know thy works, that thou	art	neither	cold nor hot: I	would thou wert	cold or	hot.</p>
				<p>“So then	because	thou art lukewarm, and neither cold	nor	hot, I will	spue thee out of my	mouth.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/3.15-16?lang=eng#14">Rev. 3:15–16</a>.)	The	summer patriot and the sunshine	saint retreat when the battle wages	fiercely around	them. Theirs is	not	the	conqueror’s	crown. They	are	overcome by	the	world.</p>
				<p>Members of the Church who have testimonies and who live clean and upright lives,	but	who	are	not	courageous and valiant,	do not gain	the	celestial kingdom. Theirs is a terrestrial inheritance.	Of them	the	revelation says, “These	are	they who are not valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus;	wherefore, they	obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.79?lang=eng#78">D&amp;C 76:79</a>.)</p>
				<p>As Jesus	said, “No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back,	is fit for the kingdom of God.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/9.62?lang=eng#61">Luke	9:62</a>.)</p>
				<p>What	is the testimony of	Jesus? And what	must we	do to be valiant therein?</p>
				<p>“Be not … ashamed of	the	testimony of our Lord,”	Paul wrote to Timothy, “… but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.8?lang=eng#7">2 Tim. 1:8</a>.) And to	the	Beloved	John came this divine message: “The	testimony of Jesus is the spirit of	prophecy.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/19.10?lang=eng#9">Rev. 19:10</a>.)</p>
				<p>The testimony of	our	Lord! The testimony	of Jesus! What a glorious and wondrous concept!	It opens the door to glory and honor with the Father and the Son forever! The testimony	of Jesus is	to believe in Christ, to receive his gospel, and to	live his law.</p>
				<p>Jesus is	the	Lord. He is	God’s own Son who came into	the	world to ransom	us men from	the	temporal and spiritual death brought upon us by	the	fall of	Adam. Jesus	has	bought us with his blood. He is	the	resurrection and the life. He “hath	abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light	through	the	gospel.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.10?lang=eng#9">2 Tim. 1:10</a>.) He is	our	Savior,	our	Redeemer, our Advocate with	the	Father.	“There is one God, and one mediator	between	God	and	men, the man Christ	Jesus.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/2.5?lang=eng#4">1	Tim. 2:5</a>.)</p>
				<p>Salvation is	in Christ. His is the only name	given under	heaven whereby this	priceless gift may be won. Without him there would be no resurrection and all men would	be forever lost. Without him there would be	no eternal life, no	return to the presence of a	gracious Father, no	celestial thrones for the saints.</p>
				<p>No tongue can tell, no mind can envision, no	heart can conceive of all that comes to	us because of him. “Worthy is the Lamb that	was	slain to receive power,	and	riches,	and	wisdom,	and	strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/5.12?lang=eng#11">Rev 5:12</a>.)</p>
				<p>Now there can be	no perfect testimony of	the	divine Sonship of Christ and his saving	goodness unless	and	until we receive the fulness of	his	everlasting	gospel.	A testimony	of the gospel comes	by revelation from the Holy	Ghost. When	the	Holy Spirit	speaks to the spirit within	us,	we then	know with an absolute conviction of	the	verity of the revealed message.</p>
				<p>A testimony is to know by revelation	that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph Smith	and	his	successors are the revealers of	the	knowledge of Christ	and	of salvation for our day; and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day	Saints is the kingdom of God on	earth, the one place where salvation may be	found.</p>
				<p>The testimony of	Jesus is the spirit	of prophecy. It	is a gift of the Spirit. It	comes in full measure only to faithful members of the Church. It is	reserved for those whose right it is to	have the constant companionship	of the Holy	Ghost. It is the spiritual endowment which sets	a man apart	as a prophet in	fulfillment	of the prayer of Moses:	“Would God that	all	the	Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit	upon them!”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/11.29?lang=eng#28">Num.	11:29</a>.)</p>
				<p>Now what	does it	mean to	be valiant in the testimony	of Jesus?</p>
				<p>It is to	be courageous and bold;	to use all our strength, energy, and ability in	the	warfare	with the world;	to fight the good fight	of faith. “Be strong and of	a good courage,” the Lord commanded	Joshua,	and	then specified that	this strength and courage consisted	of meditating upon and observing to	do all that	is written in the law of the Lord. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/josh/1.6-9?lang=eng#5">Josh.	1:6–9</a>.)	The	great cornerstone of valiance in the cause of righteousness	is obedience to	the	whole law of the whole gospel.</p>
				<p>To be valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus is to “come unto	Christ,	and	be perfected in	him”; it is	to deny	ourselves “of all ungodliness,”	and	“love God” with	all	our	“might,	mind and strength.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng#31">Moro.	10:32</a>.)</p>
				<p>To be valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus is to believe in	Christ and his gospel with unshakable conviction. It is	to know	of the verity and divinity of the Lord’s work on earth.</p>
				<p>But this	is not all.	It is more than	believing and knowing. We must be doers	of the word	and	not	hearers	only. It is	more than lip service; it is not simply	confessing with	the	mouth the divine Sonship of	the	Savior.	It is obedience	and	conformity and personal	righteousness. “Not	every one that saith unto me, Lord,	Lord, shall	enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth	the	will of	my Father which	is in heaven.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.21?lang=eng#20">Matt.	7:21</a>.)</p>
				<p>To be valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus is to “press	forward	with a steadfastness in	Christ,	having a perfect brightness	of hope, and a love	of God and of all men.”	It is to “endure to	the	end.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#19">2 Ne. 31:20</a>.) It is	to live	our	religion, to practice what we preach, to keep the commandments.	It is the manifestation	of “pure religion” in the lives	of men;	it is visiting “the	fatherless and widows in their affliction” and keeping ourselves “unspotted	from the world.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.27?lang=eng#26">James 1:27</a>.)</p>
				<p>To be valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus is to bridle	our	passions, control our appetites, and rise above	carnal and evil	things.	It is to overcome the world	as did he who is our prototype and who himself was the most	valiant	of all our Father’s	children. It is	to be morally clean, to	pay	our	tithes and offerings, to honor the Sabbath day,	to pray	with full purpose of heart,	to lay our all upon	the	altar if called	upon to	do so.</p>
				<p>To be valiant in	the	testimony of Jesus is to take the Lord’s side on every issue. It is	to vote	as he would	vote. It is	to think what he thinks, to	believe	what he	believes, to say what he would say and do what he would	do in the same situation. It is	to have	the	mind of	Christ and be one with him as he is	one	with his Father.</p>
				<p>Our doctrine	is clear; its application sometimes	seems to be	more difficult.	Perhaps	some personal introspection	might be helpful. For instance:</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	in the testimony of	Jesus if my	chief interest and concern in life is laying up	in store the treasures of the earth, rather	than the building up of	the	kingdom?</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	if I have more of this world’s goods than my just needs	and	wants require and I	do not draw	from my	surplus	to support missionary work,	build temples, and care	for	the	needy?</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	if my approach to the Church and its doctrines is intellectual only, if	I am more concerned	with having	a religious	dialogue on	this or	that point than	I am on	gaining	a personal spiritual experience?</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	if I am	deeply concerned about the Church’s	stand on who can or	who	cannot receive the priesthood and think	it is time for a new revelation	on this	doctrine?</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	if I use a boat, live in a country home, or	engage in some other recreational pursuit on weekends that takes me	away from my spiritual responsibilities?</p>
				<p>Am I	valiant	if I engage	in gambling, play cards, go	to pornographic	movies,	shop on	Sunday,	wear immodest clothes, or do any of	the	things that	are	the	accepted way of	life among worldly people?</p>
				<p>If we are to	gain salvation,	we must	put	first in our lives the things of God’s kingdom.	With us	it must	be the kingdom of God or nothing. We have come out of darkness;	ours is	the	marvelous light	of Christ. We must walk	in the light.</p>
				<p>Now I don’t pretend to be able to read the future, but I	have a very	strong feeling that	conditions in the world	are	not	going to get better. They are going	to get worse until the coming of the Son of	Man, which is the end of the world,	when the wicked	will be	destroyed.</p>
				<p>I think the world is	going to get worse,	and	the	faithful portion of	the	Church,	at least, is going to get better. The day is coming, more than ever	has	been the case in the past, when	we will	be under the obligation	of making a	choice,	of standing	up for the Church, of adhering to its precepts and teachings and principles, of	taking the counsel that	comes from the apostles	and	prophets whom God has placed to	teach the doctrine and bear	witness	to the world. The day is coming	when this will be more necessary than has ever been	the	case in	our	day	or at any time in our dispensation.</p>
				<p>Now this	is the Lord’s work.	It is God’s	work. It is	our	Father’s business. His hand	is in it. There	is nothing in this world that compares in any way in importance	with the gospel	of the Lord	Jesus Christ. It is	the	power of God unto salvation, and if	we will	walk and live and be and move and breathe and think	the	gospel and its cause, always and everlastingly,	then we	can	have peace and joy and happiness in	this life and we can go	on to eternal glory	in the life	to come.</p>
				<p>We teach	and	we testify.	We have	here this day taught eternal principles	of truth; and whenever we teach	by the power of	the	Holy Spirit, it	becomes	our	prerogative	to bear	witness	and	testimony that the doctrines we	have proclaimed	are	true and that if men will abide	by and conform to them,	all	the	blessings that a gracious Father desires to	confer upon	them will be theirs.</p>
				<p>I bear witness of the truth of the doctrines	that have been proclaimed and testify anew that	Jesus is the Lord, that	salvation is in	him, that his is the only name under heaven	whereby	we may be saved	in God’s kingdom.</p>
				<p>God grant us	the	wisdom and vision and determination, the valiance and courage, to fight	manfully in	his	army and to	be,	as President George	Albert Smith so	graphically	expressed it, “on the Lord’s side of the line.”	In the name	of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
