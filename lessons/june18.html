<p>Watch as these young men discover the rewards of embarking in the service of God with the Seven Days of Service Activity.</p>
<h1>The Challenge</h1>

<p>Team up with one or more quorum members and commit to a week of service.</p>

<p>Together, brainstorm ways that you can serve members of your family or people in your ward and community. Consider gathering lists of needs in the ward from your Young Men leaders, Bishop, or the leaders of Elders Quorum and Relief Society. Then choose various acts of service to do for your families or others for the next seven days and write them down and keep track. Record in your journal how you feel as you serve.</p>

<p>At the end of the seven days, you will share your story here on this app.<p>

<p>Each individual who completes this challenge will be awarded 500-2,500 points based on the service performed and the story shared (Awarded by the Young Mens leaders).</p>
