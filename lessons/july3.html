<p>The Bishop's Weekly Message focuses on the 4th of July</p>

<h1>I believe that our For-Fathers - WHO WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE - were Inspired and Trusted in God.</h1>

<p>They Fought for Freedom in Many Ways</p>

<p>They Believed and Trusted in God so Much that They Even Place our Motto on US Currency - reflecting His Name “In God We Trust.”</p>

<p>In the BOM there are numerous battles between the Nephites and Laminates - where the Nephite’s fought for their freedom of Religion</p>

<p>The Nephites Trusted in God and sough for His Help many - many times!</p>

<p>You have 4 Challenges this Week</p>

<p>1 – Listen to this Message for 100 Points</p>

<p>2 – Read All the Verses of The Star Spangled Banner for 200 points</p>

<p>O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br>
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br>
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br>
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</p>

<p>On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep<br>
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br>
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,<br>
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br>
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,<br>
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,<br>
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</p>

<p>And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,<br>
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion<br>
A home and a Country should leave us no more?<br>
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.<br>
No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br>
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,<br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<p>

<p>O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand<br>
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!<br>
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land<br>
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!<br>
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br>
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” <br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>
