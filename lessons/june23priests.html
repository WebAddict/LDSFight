<p class="pmfont">Staying true to the teachings of Jesus Christ is like staying safe in a boat traveling through dangerous whitewater rapids. Elder M. Russell Ballard urges all of us to stay in “the boat,” wear a life jacket, and hold on. If we have fallen out of the boat, we can depend on those who love us to find us and pull us back to safety.</p>

<p>Through Priests river trips lead by Brother Chris Rigby and many river trips with my own family over the last 5 years, I have come to love and respect the river. What a fun activity a river trip can be. I have also seen first hand how a river trip can turn from fun to, well, not fun. </p>

<p>One experience happened two years ago as we went on a large family outing down the lower salt. The water level was high and the current was moving swiftly. I had my wife and two youngest daughters in a canoe. As we approached a large rapid, we hit a boulder and all but my then 6 year old daughter were thrown into the water. My wife had hold of our then 2 year old and I fought to keep the boat upright so my 6 year old would not fall out of the boat. We got past the rapid and calm ensued as we all got back in. As we sat on the shore watching that particular rapid, we saw a couple other canoes flip. We even watched as one canoe flipped and became completely submerged and stuck in the water. I was grateful for life vests that day. That day, I learned that you never know what lies beneath. The goal is always to stay in the boat. But, if you fall out, there is always a way back in.</p>

<p>In life, Satan would have you think that what lies beneath is no big deal. What looks like not much can potentially be a raging current below. He would like you to think that if you fall out, it is next to impossible to get back in.</p>

<p>As the video states, the Lord has provided us with a boat, a life jacket and experienced guides to help us down that river of life.</p>

<p>How grateful I am for a great Bishop and his counselors and wonderful Young Men leaders of the Allen Ranch ward and amazing parents to help us navigate the river of life.</p>

<p>I know the Lord blesses and protects us as we strive to do what’s right. I also know He leads, loves and helps us if we fall out of the boat and strive to get back in.</p>

<p>What an awesome plan!!</p>
