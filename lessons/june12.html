			<p>My message this week comes from brother Tom Steele</p>

			<p>He talked to me and said that sometimes we're the hammer, sometimes we're the nail, and sometimes we're the anvil.</p>

			<p>I use this analogy up at Scout camp with our young men. I told him between the ages of 12 and 18 they are actually the nail.</p>

			<p>And the hammer is their parents their grandparents us as leaders, Scout leaders, Sunday School leaders. We are responsible for molding them into the future leaders, future young men and missionaries that they will be.</p>

			<p>The anvil is actually the plan of salvation from our Heavenly Father and the atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ is that anvil helps us mold them into the young men and future leaders, husbands and fathers that we want them to be.</p>

			<p>The scripture this week is from Isaiah 41:7. I admonish you to go to there and read that scripture and see how it relates to my message this week.</p>

			<p>I testified you these things in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ, Amen!</p>
			<p style="text-align: right;">-- Bishop James Cobb</p>

			<h1>Isaiah 41:7</h1>
			<p>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, <em>and</em> he that smootheth <em>with</em> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It <em>is</em> ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, <em>that</em> it should not be moved.</p>
