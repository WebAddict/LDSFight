				<p>My beloved brethren and sisters,	I rejoice to be	with you in	another	glorious general conference	of the Church. How grateful	I am for the love, prayers,	and	service	of the devoted members of the Church throughout	the	world.</p>
				<p>May I commend you faithful Saints who are striving to flood the earth and your lives	with the Book of Mormon. Not only must we move forward in a	monumental manner more copies of the Book of Mormon, but we	must move boldly forward into our own lives	and	throughout the earth more of its marvelous messages.</p>
				<p>This	sacred volume was written for us—for our day. Its scriptures are to	be likened unto	ourselves. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23?lang=eng#22">1 Ne. 19:23</a>.)</p>
				<p>The Doctrine	and	Covenants tells	us that	the	Book of	Mormon is the “record of a fallen people.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9?lang=eng#8">D&amp;C 20:9</a>.)	Why	did	they fall? This	is one of the major	messages of	the	Book of	Mormon.	Mormon gives the answer	in the closing chapters	of the book	in these words:	“Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of	the	Nephites, hath proven their	destruction.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.27?lang=eng#26">Moro. 8:27</a>.)	And	then, lest we miss that	momentous Book of Mormon message from that fallen people, the Lord warns us	in the Doctrine	and	Covenants, “Beware of pride, lest ye become	as the Nephites	of old.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.39?lang=eng#38">D&amp;C 38:39</a>.)</p>
				<p>I earnestly seek	an interest	in your	faith and prayers as I strive to bring forth light on this Book	of Mormon message—the sin of pride.	This message has been weighing heavily on my soul for some time. I know	the	Lord wants this	message	delivered now.</p>
				<p>In the premortal	council, it	was	pride that felled Lucifer, “a son of the morning.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.12-15?lang=eng#11">2 Ne. 24:12–15</a>;	see	also <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25-27?lang=eng#24">D&amp;C 76:25–27</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3?lang=eng#2">Moses 4:3</a>.) At the end of this world, when God cleanses the earth by	fire, the proud	will be	burned as stubble and the meek shall inherit the earth.	(See <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.5?lang=eng#4">3 Ne. 12:5</a>,	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/25.1?lang=eng#0">3 Ne. 25:1</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.9?lang=eng#8">D&amp;C	29:9</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.37?lang=eng#36">JS—H 1:37</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/4.1?lang=eng#0">Mal.	4:1</a>.)</p>
				<p>Three times in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord uses the phrase “beware of pride,” including a warning to	the	second elder of	the	Church,	Oliver Cowdery,	and	to Emma	Smith, the wife	of the Prophet.	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/23.1?lang=eng#0">D&amp;C 23:1</a>;	see	also <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.14?lang=eng#13">D&amp;C	25:14</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.39?lang=eng#38">D&amp;C 38:39</a>.)</p>
				<p>Pride is	a very misunderstood sin, and many are sinning in ignorance. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.11?lang=eng#10">Mosiah 3:11</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.18?lang=eng#17">3 Ne. 6:18</a>.) In the scriptures	there is no	such thing as righteous	pride—it is	always considered a	sin. Therefore,	no matter how the world	uses the term, we must understand how God uses the term	so we can understand the language of holy writ and profit thereby. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15?lang=eng#14">2 Ne. 4:15</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.3-7?lang=eng#2">Mosiah 1:3–7</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.61?lang=eng#60">Alma 5:61</a>.)</p>
				<p>Most	of us think	of pride as	self-centeredness, conceit,	boastfulness, arrogance, or	haughtiness. All of	these are elements of the sin, but the heart, or core, is still	missing.</p>
				<p>The central feature of pride	is enmity—enmity toward	God	and	enmity toward our fellowmen. <em>Enmity</em> means “hatred toward, hostility to, or	a state	of opposition.”	It is the power	by which Satan wishes to reign over	us.</p>
				<p>Pride is	essentially	competitive	in nature. We pit our will against God’s. When we direct our pride toward God, it is in	the	spirit of “my will and not thine be	done.” As Paul said, they “seek	their own, not the things which	are	Jesus Christ’s.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/2.21?lang=eng#20">Philip. 2:21</a>.)</p>
				<p>Our will	in competition to God’s	will allows	desires, appetites,	and	passions to	go unbridled. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12?lang=eng#11">Alma 38:12</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.30?lang=eng#29">3 Ne. 12:30</a>.)</p>
				<p>The proud cannot	accept the authority of	God	giving direction to	their lives. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.6?lang=eng#5">Hel. 12:6</a>.)	They pit their perceptions of truth	against	God’s great	knowledge, their abilities versus God’s	priesthood power, their	accomplishments	against	His	mighty works.</p>
				<p>Our enmity toward God takes on many labels, such	as rebellion, hard-heartedness,	stiff-neckedness, unrepentant, puffed up, easily offended, and sign	seekers. The proud wish	God	would agree	with them. They	aren’t interested in changing their	opinions to	agree with God’s.</p>
				<p>Another major portion of	this very prevalent	sin	of pride is	enmity toward our fellowmen. We	are	tempted	daily to elevate ourselves above others	and	diminish them. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.17?lang=eng#16">Hel.	6:17</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.41?lang=eng#40">D&amp;C 58:41</a>.)</p>
				<p>The proud make every	man	their adversary	by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other	worldly	measuring device against others. In	the	words of C.	S. Lewis: “Pride gets no pleasure out of having	something, only	out	of having more of it than the next man.	… It is	the	comparison that	makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once	the	element	of competition has gone, pride has gone.” (<em>Mere	Christianity,</em> New York: Macmillan,	1952, pp. 109–10.)</p>
				<p>In the pre-earthly council, Lucifer placed his proposal in competition with the Father’s	plan as	advocated by Jesus Christ. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1-3?lang=eng#0">Moses 4:1–3</a>.) He wished	to be honored above	all	others.	(See <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.13?lang=eng#12">2	Ne.	24:13</a>.)	In short, his prideful desire was to dethrone God. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36?lang=eng#35">D&amp;C 29:36</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.28?lang=eng#27">D&amp;C 76:28</a>.)</p>
				<p>The scriptures abound with evidences	of the severe consequences of the sin of pride to individuals, groups, cities, and nations.	“Pride goeth before	destruction.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/16.18?lang=eng#17">Prov.	16:18</a>.)	It destroyed the Nephite nation	and	the	city of	Sodom. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.27?lang=eng#26">Moro. 8:27</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ezek/16.49-50?lang=eng#48">Ezek.	16:49–50</a>.)</p>
				<p>It was through pride	that Christ	was	crucified. The Pharisees were wroth	because	Jesus claimed to be	the	Son	of God,	which was a	threat to their	position, and so they plotted His death. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/11.53?lang=eng#52">John 11:53</a>.)</p>
				<p>Saul	became an enemy	to David through pride.	He was jealous because the crowds of Israelite women were singing that “Saul hath slain	his	thousands, and David his ten thousands.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/18.6-8?lang=eng#5">1	Sam. 18:6–8</a>.)</p>
				<p>The proud stand more	in fear	of men’s judgment than of God’s	judgment. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.6-7?lang=eng#5">D&amp;C 3:6–7</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30.1-2?lang=eng#0">D&amp;C 30:1–2</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60.2?lang=eng#1">D&amp;C	60:2</a>.) “What will men think	of me?”	weighs heavier than	“What will God think of	me?”</p>
				<p>King	Noah was about to free the prophet Abinadi,	but	an appeal to his pride by his wicked priests sent Abinadi to the flames. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17.11-12?lang=eng#10">Mosiah 17:11–12</a>.) Herod	sorrowed at	the	request	of his wife	to behead John the Baptist.	But	his	prideful desire	to look	good to	“them which	sat	with him at	meat” caused him to	kill John. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/14.9?lang=eng#8">Matt. 14:9</a>; see also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/6.26?lang=eng#25">Mark 6:26</a>.)</p>
				<p>Fear	of men’s judgment manifests	itself in competition for men’s	approval. The proud	love “the praise of	men	more than the praise of	God.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/12.42-43?lang=eng#41">John 12:42–43</a>.) Our motives for the things	we do are where	the	sin	is manifest. Jesus said	He did “always those things” that pleased God. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.29?lang=eng#28">John 8:29</a>.) Would	we not do well to have the pleasing	of God as our motive rather	than to	try	to elevate ourselves above our brother and outdo another?</p>
				<p>Some	prideful people	are	not	so concerned as	to whether their wages meet	their needs	as they	are	that their wages are more than someone else’s. Their reward	is being a cut above the rest. This	is the enmity of pride.</p>
				<p>When	pride has a	hold on	our	hearts,	we lose	our	independence of	the	world and deliver our freedoms to the bondage of men’s judgment. The world shouts louder than the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. The reasoning of men overrides	the	revelations	of God,	and	the	proud let go of	the	iron rod. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.19-28?lang=eng#18">1	Ne.	8:19–28</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.25?lang=eng#24">1	Ne.	11:25</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.23-24?lang=eng#22">1 Ne. 15:23–24</a>.)</p>
				<p>Pride is	a sin that can readily be seen in others but is	rarely admitted	in ourselves. Most of us consider pride	to be a	sin	of those on	the	top, such as the rich and the learned, looking down	at the rest	of us. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.42?lang=eng#41">2 Ne. 9:42</a>.) There is, however,	a far more common ailment among	us—and that	is pride from the bottom looking up. It	is manifest	in so many ways, such as faultfinding, gossiping, backbiting, murmuring, living	beyond our means, envying, coveting, withholding gratitude and praise that might lift another, and being unforgiving and jealous.</p>
				<p>Disobedience	is essentially a prideful power	struggle against someone in	authority over us. It can be a parent, a priesthood	leader,	a teacher, or ultimately God. A	proud person hates the fact	that someone is	above him. He thinks this lowers his position.</p>
				<p>Selfishness is one of the more common faces of pride. “How everything affects me” is	the	center of all that matters—self-conceit, self-pity,	worldly	self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking.</p>
				<p>Pride results in	secret combinations	which are built	up to get power, gain, and glory of	the	world. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.5?lang=eng#4">Hel. 7:5</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.9,16,22-23?lang=eng#8">Ether 8:9, 16, 22–23</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.31?lang=eng#30">Moses 5:31</a>.) This fruit of	the	sin	of pride, namely secret	combinations, brought down both	the	Jaredite and the Nephite civilizations and has been	and	will yet be	the	cause of the fall of many nations. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.18-25?lang=eng#17">Ether 8:18–25</a>.)</p>
				<p>Another face	of pride is	contention.	Arguments, fights, unrighteous dominion, generation	gaps, divorces,	spouse abuse, riots, and disturbances all fall into	this category of pride.</p>
				<p>Contention in our families drives the Spirit	of the Lord	away. It also drives many of our family	members	away. Contention ranges	from a hostile spoken word to worldwide	conflicts. The scriptures tell us that “only by	pride cometh contention.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/13.10?lang=eng#9">Prov. 13:10</a>; see also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/28.25?lang=eng#24">Prov.	28:25</a>.)</p>
				<p>The scriptures testify that the proud are easily	offended and hold grudges. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.1-3?lang=eng#0">1 Ne. 16:1–3</a>.)	They withhold forgiveness to keep another in their debt	and	to justify their injured feelings.</p>
				<p>The proud do	not	receive	counsel	or correction easily. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/15.10?lang=eng#9">Prov. 15:10</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/amos/5.10?lang=eng#9">Amos	5:10</a>.) Defensiveness is	used by	them to	justify	and	rationalize	their frailties	and	failures. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/3.9?lang=eng#8">Matt. 3:9</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.30-59?lang=eng#29">John	6:30–59</a>.)</p>
				<p>The proud depend	upon the world to tell them	whether	they have value	or not.	Their self-esteem is determined	by where they are judged to	be on the ladders of worldly success. They feel	worthwhile as individuals if the numbers beneath them in achievement, talent, beauty, or intellect are large enough. Pride is ugly.	It says, “If you succeed, I	am a failure.”</p>
				<p>If we love God, do His will,	and	fear His judgment more than	men’s, we will have	self-esteem.</p>
				<p>Pride is	a damning sin in the true sense	of that	word. It limits	or stops progression. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10-11?lang=eng#9">Alma 12:10–11</a>.) The proud	are	not	easily taught. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.3,7-11?lang=eng#2">1 Ne. 15:3,	7–11</a>.) They	won’t change their minds to	accept truths, because to do so	implies	they have been wrong.</p>
				<p>Pride adversely affects all our relationships—our relationship with God and His servants, between husband and wife, parent and child, employer and employee,	teacher	and	student, and all mankind. Our degree of	pride determines how we	treat our God and our brothers and sisters.	Christ wants to	lift us	to where He	is.	Do we desire to	do the same	for	others?</p>
				<p>Pride fades our feelings	of sonship to God and brotherhood to man. It separates and divides us by “ranks,” according	to our “riches”	and	our	“chances for learning.”	(<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.12?lang=eng#11">3 Ne. 6:12</a>.) Unity	is impossible for a	proud people, and unless we	are	one	we are not the Lord’s. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.21?lang=eng#20">Mosiah 18:21</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#26">D&amp;C	38:27</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.2-4?lang=eng#1">D&amp;C 105:2–4</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#17">Moses 7:18</a>.)</p>
				<p>Think of	what pride has cost	us in the past and what	it is now costing us in	our	own	lives, our families, and the Church.</p>
				<p>Think of	the	repentance that	could take place with lives	changed, marriages preserved, and homes	strengthened, if pride did not keep	us from	confessing our sins	and	forsaking them.	(See <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.43?lang=eng#42">D&amp;C	58:43</a>.)</p>
				<p>Think of	the	many who are less active members of	the	Church because they	were offended and their	pride will not allow them to forgive or	fully sup at the Lord’s	table.</p>
				<p>Think of	the	tens of	thousands of additional	young men and couples who could	be on missions except for the pride	that keeps them	from yielding their	hearts unto	God. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.6?lang=eng#5">Alma 10:6</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.34-35?lang=eng#33">Hel. 3:34–35</a>.)</p>
				<p>Think how temple	work would increase	if the time	spent in this godly	service	were more important	than the many prideful pursuits	that compete for our time.</p>
				<p>Pride affects all of	us at various times	and	in various degrees.	Now	you	can	see	why	the	building in	Lehi’s dream that represents the pride of the world	was	large and spacious and great was the multitude that	did	enter into it. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26,33?lang=eng#25">1 Ne. 8:26, 33</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.35-36?lang=eng#34">1 Ne. 11:35–36</a>.)</p>
				<p>Pride is	the	universal sin, the great vice. Yes,	pride <em>is</em> the universal	sin, the great vice.</p>
				<p>The antidote	for	pride is humility—meekness,	submissiveness.	(See <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23?lang=eng#22">Alma 7:23</a>.) It	is the broken heart	and	contrite spirit. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng#19">3	Ne.	9:20</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.19?lang=eng#18">3 Ne. 12:19</a>;	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#36">D&amp;C 20:37</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.8?lang=eng#7">D&amp;C 59:8</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/34.18?lang=eng#17">Ps. 34:18</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/57.15?lang=eng#14">Isa.	57:15</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/66.2?lang=eng#1">Isa.	66:2</a>.) As Rudyard Kipling put it so	well:</p>
				<div class="stanza">
					<p><em>The tumult and the shouting dies;</em></p>
					<p><em>The captains	and	the	kings depart.</em></p>
					<p><em>Still stands	thine ancient sacrifice,</em></p>
					<p><em>An humble and a contrite	heart.</em></p>
					<p><em>Lord	God	of Hosts, be with us yet,</em></p>
					<p><em>Lest	we forget, lest	we forget.</em></p>
				</div>
				<p>God will	have a humble people. Either we	can	choose to be humble	or we can be compelled to be humble. Alma said,	“Blessed are they who humble themselves	without	being compelled	to be humble.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.16?lang=eng#15">Alma 32:16</a>.)</p>
				<p>Let us choose to	be humble.</p>
				<p>We can choose to	humble ourselves by	conquering enmity toward our brothers and sisters, esteeming them as ourselves,	and	lifting	them as	high or	higher than	we are.

				<p>We can choose to	humble ourselves by	going on missions and preaching	the	word that can humble others. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.19?lang=eng#18">Alma 4:19</a>; <a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.5?lang=eng#4">Alma 31:5</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.20?lang=eng#19">Alma 48:20</a>.)</p>
				<p>We can choose to	humble ourselves by	getting	to the temple more frequently.</p>
				<p>We can choose to	humble ourselves by	confessing and forsaking our sins and being	born of	God.

				<p>Let us choose to	be humble. We can do it. I know	we can.</p>
				<p>My dear brethren	and	sisters, we	must prepare to	redeem Zion. It	was	essentially	the	sin	of pride that kept us from establishing	Zion in	the	days of	the	Prophet	Joseph Smith. It was the same sin of pride that	brought	consecration to	an end among the Nephites. (See	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.24-25?lang=eng#23">4 Ne. 1:24–25</a>.)</p>
				<p>Pride is	the	great stumbling	block to Zion. I repeat: Pride <em>is</em> the great stumbling block to	Zion.</p>
				<p>We must cleanse the inner vessel	by conquering pride. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.2-4?lang=eng#1">Alma 6:2–4</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/23.25-26?lang=eng#24">Matt. 23:25–26</a>.)</p>
				<p>We must yield “to the enticings of the Holy Spirit,”	put	off	the	prideful “natural man,”	become “a saint	through	the	atonement of Christ	the	Lord,” and become “as a	child, submissive, meek, humble.” (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18">Mosiah	3:19</a>; see also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.28?lang=eng#27">Alma 13:28</a>.)</p>
				<p>That	we may do so and go	on to fulfill our divine destiny is	my fervent prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
