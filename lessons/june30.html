<h1>Whether today’s starting out rough, your bad day is finally over, or you’re right in the middle of the worst day ever, there’s someone who can make it better.</h1>

<p>Because of the Atonement, Jesus knows exactly what you’re going through and how to help. All you have to do is pray and ask for His help.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">1. He will bring you peace</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>There’s a reason Christ is called the Prince of Peace. You can feel that peace through the Spirit long after you pray.</p>
<p><em>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.27?lang=eng#26" onclick="newWindow(this.href); return false;">John 14:27</a>).</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">2. He will lift you up</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>No matter what is weighing you down, tell your Heavenly Father about it. Hold on to your faith in Jesus Christ, and you will feel extra strength buoying up.</p>
<p><em>“Every person, young and old, has had his own personal experience with falling. Falling is what we mortals do. … With faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the power and hope of the restored gospel, you will be able to walk tall and continue on” (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/you-can-do-it-now?lang=eng">You Can Do It Now!</a>”</em> Ensign, <em>Nov. 2013, 57).</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">3. He will comfort you</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>The Holy Ghost will bring you the comfort you need from Jesus Christ, who knows exactly what will help you. Remember: He’s experienced it all before.</p>
<p><em>“Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/49.13?lang=eng#12" onclick="newWindow(this.href); return false;">Isaiah 49:13</a>).</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">4. He will help you see the good</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>It’s hard to see what’s going right when everything seems to be going wrong. But Christ has sent you the Spirit, and with His help, you can see the ways God has blessed your life.</p>
<p><em>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#25" onclick="newWindow(this.href); return false;">John 14:26</a>).</em></p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">5. He will help you feel His love</h1>
<img alt="Jesus hugs a man" class="full-image" src="https://www.lds.org/youth/bc/youth/content/images/Jesus-Hug.gif">
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus’s love is always there, but with the help of the Holy Ghost, He will make sure you get an extra dose when you need it.</p>
<p><em>“I have a testimony in my heart, brothers and sisters, that God, our Heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ know and love us individually” (Ronald A. Rasband, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/one-by-one?lang=eng">One by One</a>,”</em> Ensign, <em>Nov. 2000, 30).</em></p>
