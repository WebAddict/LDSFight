<h1 class="pmfont">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</h1>

<p>Exodus 20:8</p>

<h2 class="pmfont">Sabbath Day Observance</h2>
<p>From For the Strength of Youth, 30–31</p>

<p>The Lord has given the Sabbath day for your benefit and has commanded you to keep it holy.</p>

<p>Honoring the Sabbath day includes attending all your Church meetings. Go to sacrament meeting prepared to worship the Lord and partake worthily of the sacrament. During sacrament meeting, be reverent and willing to learn. Refrain from activities that would distract you or others during this sacred meeting. Be on time for your meetings. As you do these things, you invite the Spirit of the Lord to be with you.</p>

<p>Prepare during the week so that you can reserve Sunday for the many uplifting activities that are appropriate for the Sabbath day. Such activities include spending quiet time with your family, studying the gospel, fulfilling your Church callings and responsibilities, serving others, writing letters, writing in your journal, and doing family history work. Your behavior and dress on the Sabbath should show respect for the Lord and His holy day.</p>

<p>Sunday is not a day for shopping, recreation, or athletic events. Do not seek entertainment or make purchases on this day. Let others know what your standards are so they can support you. When seeking a job, share with your potential employer your desire to attend your Sunday meetings and keep the Sabbath day holy. Whenever possible, choose a job that does not require you to work on Sundays.</p>

<p>Observing the Sabbath will bring you closer to the Lord and to your family. It will give you an eternal perspective and spiritual strength.</p>

<p>Isaiah 58:13–14; Doctrine and Covenants 59:9–13</p>
