<h1>The Willie Handcart Company</h1>
<p>Faith in God and a burning desire to gather to Zion brought the Willie handcart pioneers to Sixth Crossing, an isolated place on the Sweetwater River, on October 19, 1856. If they had reached Sixth Crossing in late August or early September, it likely would have been a pleasant place to camp. One trail guidebook described it as having “grass in abundance up and down the creek, sage brush and willows for fuel.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t summer. The morning of October 19 dawned very cold, and to reach the Sixth Crossing of the Sweetwater, the Willie company faced a daunting journey of 16½ miles from their camp at the Fifth Crossing. They struggled to get moving but finally started. After they had traveled a few miles, the season’s first snowstorm blew in and blasted them for about half an hour. The storm was so blustery and cold that they stopped to wait it out.</p>

<p>Making matters worse, the people had been getting weaker from being on reduced rations for more than two weeks. They had stretched their flour supply as far as they could, and that day they ate “the last pound.” All they had left were a few cattle and a one-day supply of crackers. Unless they were rescued, they would certainly die. They prayed constantly that help would come before it was too late.</p>

<p>When the storm subsided, the Willie company started moving again. At about noon they were met by four express riders from the first group of rescuers sent by President Brigham Young. The arrival of these men—Joseph A. Young, Cyrus Wheelock, Stephen Taylor, and Abel Garr—brought great rejoicing. “Such a shout as was raised in camp I never before heard,” wrote Joseph Elder. “They were saviors coming to [our] relief.” The four express riders had little food to give, but they brought hope, giving “the cheering intelligence that assistance was near at hand, that several wagons loaded with flour, onions, & clothing, including bedding, were within a day’s drive.” After staying briefly, these men continued east to search for the Martin company, which was 100 miles farther back on the trail.</p>

<p>Of necessity, that afternoon the Willie company pushed west another 9 or 10 miles to the Sixth Crossing of the Sweetwater, arriving at dark. They issued the last of their food—the crackers—that night.</p>

<p>When the people awoke the next morning, they found snow at least four inches deep and still falling. Five people had died the previous day, and many more were close to death. In their weakened condition, the Willie company could go no farther. But their situation was so desperate that they couldn’t just sit and wait for the wagons to come. That morning, Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder set out to look for the rescuers.</p>

<p>These two men expected to find the rescuers at the base of Rocky Ridge, about 12 miles away. The rescuers weren’t there, however, so James Willie and Joseph Elder ascended Rocky Ridge and continued about 15 more miles, straining their eyes and ears for any sign of the rescuers. “The snow and an awful cold wind blew in our faces all day,” wrote Joseph Elder. Finally, after traveling more than 25 miles through snow and wind, they found the rescuers camped below the mouth of Willow Creek. A signboard that Harvey Cluff had just placed on the trail directed the two men to the camp. Without that sign, they might have passed by it.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that James Willie and Joseph Elder had gone searching for the rescuers. The previous day, the rescue team had pulled off the main trail to seek shelter. As the storm continued on the 20th, they had remained in camp, not knowing the extremity of the Willie company’s condition until the two men arrived that night.</p>

<p>At 8:00 the next morning, October 21, James Willie, Joseph Elder, and the rescuers started for the Willie camp with all haste. The people in camp were in a precarious condition. Most of them had been without food, other than a little meat, since the crackers were distributed on the night of the 19th. Five people died during the two days that James Willie and Joseph Elder were gone.</p>

<p>Rescuer Harvey Cluff said that after an “extremely difficult” all-day journey, “it was about sunset when we came in sight of the camp.” When the rescuers arrived, the joy in camp was unrestrained. Little children “danced around with gladness,” and “strong men wept till tears ran freely down their furrowed and sun-burnt cheeks.” “The sisters fell upon [the rescuers] and deluged them with kisses.” Feeling unbounded joy and gratitude, the people dropped to their knees and gave thanks to God. The food, bedding, and clothing that people in the Salt Lake Valley had so charitably donated would save many lives.</p>

<p>The next day, George Grant left some of his men and six wagons to help the Willie company. The rest of his small group of rescuers continued east to search for the Martin company and the Hodgetts and Hunt wagon companies. </p>

<p>“We have prayed without ceasing,” George Grant wrote to Brigham Young after finding these three companies more than a week later, “and the blessing of God has been with us.” The emigrants had sacrificed much to gather to Zion. If it weren’t for the timely rescue, many more would have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
