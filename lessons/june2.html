Ridd, then	serving	as a member	of the Young Men general presidency. “As members of	the	choice generation, you understand technology. Use it to	accelerate your	progress toward	perfection.”</p></div></div>


				<p>In his April	2014 general conference	talk, Brother Randall L. Ridd, then	second counselor in	the	Young Men general presidency, made the following statement:	“Young men,	don’t do dumb things with your smartphone. You all know	what I mean. There are countless ways technology can distract you from what	is most	important. Follow the adage	‘Be	where you are when you are there.’ When	you	are	driving, drive.	When you are in	class, focus on	the	lesson.	When you are with your friends,	give them the gift of your attention. Your brain cannot	concentrate	on two things at once” (“<a	target="_blank"	href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/04/the-choice-generation?lang=eng">The Choice	Generation</a>”).</p>
				<p>I loved that	talk and have been pondering the message “don’t	do dumb	things with	your smartphone.” What if we changed that statement	to “do smart things	with your smartphone”?</p>

				<p>Use technology to accelerate	the	work of	salvation and your progress	to perfection and to serve God and others.</p>

				<h2>Do smart things	with your smartphone</h2>
				<p>Recently	I observed two examples	of this	concept.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>First, in Colorado on a training	assignment,	I had the privilege	to attend two firesides, each attended by approximately	400	young men, where I posed this question:	“Young men,	what smart things are you doing	with your smartphone?” One young man in	the	back raised	his	hand. I	called upon	him	and	he stood. He seemed	to be the type of priest that all young	deacons	aspire to become. He boldly	declared: “I charge	my phone at	night in my	mother’s bedroom.” The Holy	Ghost immediately touched my heart.	Here was a young man that knew and understood how to avoid temptation and do smart things with his smartphone.</p>
				<p>The second example is from watching a deacons quorum	president conduct his quorum meeting on	a Sunday. He asked his fellow deacons how they had done	on their assignment	to read	the	Book of	Mormon that	week. When it became apparent that some	may	not	have done as well as they could	have done, he reminded them	of the quorum’s	commitment that	each member	would read the Book	of Mormon that year. Then he said, “I will text	you	during the week	to remind you of this commitment.” Again, my heart pounded as I	felt the Holy Ghost	confirm	that here was another young	man	doing smart	things with	his	smartphone.</p>
				<p><strong>Use technology to hasten	the	work of	salvation</strong></p>
				<p>In the same conference address, Brother Ridd	stated:	“The divine	purpose	of technology is to	hasten the work	of salvation. As members of	the	choice generation, you understand technology. Use it to	accelerate your	progress toward	perfection.”</p>
				<p>How can you hasten the work of salvation	on your	smart phone? I have	seen many examples,	such as:</p>
				<ul><li>
				<div>A young lady reading her scriptures before	sacrament meeting.</div>
				</li><li>
				<div>Another young lady	sending	her	friends	a video	she	recently saw on	<a href="https://www.mormon.org/">Mormon.org</a>.</div>
				</li><li>
				<div>A priest setting a	reminder on	his	phone that he committed	to do three	hours of indexing during the week.</div>
				</li><li>
				<div>A teachers	quorum president texting a new quorum member to	remind him of an activity.</div>
				</li><li>
				<div>A young man sending his mother	a text just	to tell	her	that he	loves her. (Can	you	imagine	how	many mothers would be pleasantly shocked with that text?)</div>
				</li></ul>
				<p><strong>Accelerate your progress	to perfection</strong></p>
				<p>I encourage each	of you to think	about how you are using	technology.	Are	you	using it to	accelerate your	progress to	perfection?	Or are some	of us being	“lulled” by	the	adversary, as indicated	in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21?lang=eng#20"	onclick="newWindow(this.href); return false;">2	Nephi 28:21</a>:</p>
				<p>“And	others will	he pacify, and lull	them away into carnal security,	that they will say:	All	is well	in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus	the	devil cheateth their souls,	and	leadeth	them away carefully	down to	hell.”</p>
				<p>Satan very much wants to	lull this chosen generation. I believe that	smartphones	can	be one of the greatest tools for good that Heavenly	Father has ever	created. Likewise, I know that there must be opposition	in all things, and a wise enemy	has	determined how to use this wonderful technology	to distract, tempt,	lull, and persuade this	chosen generation.</p>
				<p>Self-control	is part	of perfection. Learn to	control	your desire	to constantly be using this	technology.	Take time to put technology	aside and spend	time with your Heavenly	Father,	your family, and your friends.</p>

				<p><strong>Use your	smartphone to serve</strong></p>
				<p>Please take the question	“How can I use my smartphone to	serve my God?” to your Heavenly	Father and your	parents. I promise you that	He will	answer your	thoughtful prayer and pleading to make a change. Please	listen to His answer. It may come through your parents.	It may come	through	a lesson in	seminary. It may come through a	conference talk. It	may	come from a	loving Church leader. Please listen	and	then act. You and generations to come will be blessed as a result.</p>
