<h1>Does the music I listen to invite the Spirit?</h1>
<p>Have you asked yourself this question recently? Now is a great time to reflect on the music that you listen to and ask yourself this question! Let's revist our Strength of Youth to know exactly what is asked of us.</p>

<h1>From For the Strength of Youth - Music and Dancing</h1>

<h3 class="pmfont">Praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing.</h3>
<h4>Doctrine and Covenants 136:28</h4>

<p>Music can enrich your life. It can edify and inspire you and help you draw closer to Heavenly Father. Music has a profound effect on your mind, spirit, and behavior.</p>

<p>Choose carefully the music you listen to. Pay attention to how you feel when you are listening. Some music can carry evil and destructive messages. Do not listen to music that encourages immorality or glorifies violence through its lyrics, beat, or intensity. Do not listen to music that uses vulgar or offensive language or promotes evil practices. Such music can dull your spiritual sensitivity.</p>

<p>Learn and sing the hymns. Hymns can lift your spirit, move you to righteous action, and help you withstand the temptations of the adversary.</p>

<p>When listening to music, be courteous to those around you. Keep your music at a reasonable volume, and remove your earphones when others are talking to you or want you to be part of their activities. Remember that the Spirit speaks with a still, small voice. If you listen to music constantly, you may not have the quiet time you need for thinking, feeling, and receiving spiritual guidance.</p>

<p>Dancing can be fun and can provide an opportunity to meet new people. However, it too can be misused. When dancing, avoid full body contact with your partner. Do not use positions or moves that are suggestive of sexual or violent behavior or are otherwise inappropriate.</p>

<p>Attend only those dances where dress, grooming, lighting, lyrics, music, and entertainment contribute to a wholesome atmosphere where the Spirit may be present.</p>
