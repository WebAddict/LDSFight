			  <h1>As we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light in the lives of others.</h1>


				<p>We will be different as we decide not to fill our minds with media choices that are base and demeaning and that will remove the Spirit from our homes and our lives. We will certainly stand out as we make choices regarding moralityâ€”choices which adhere to gospel principles and standards. Those things which make us different from most of the world also provide us with that light and that spirit which will shine in an increasingly dark world.</p>
				<p>By <strong>President Thomas S. Monson</strong><br>From &quot;Be an Example and a Light&quot; - Oct 2015 General Conference</p>
