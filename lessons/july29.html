<p>“If you’re not a full-time missionary with a missionary badge pinned on your coat, now is the time to paint one on your heart—painted, as Paul said, 'not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.' ...</p>

<p>“Our desire to share the gospel takes all of us to our knees, and it should, because we need the Lord’s help.”</p>
<p>-- Elder Neil L. Andersen, “It’s a Miracle,” Liahona, May 2013</p>

<h1>F.I.G.H.T. Challenge</h1>
<p>1. Picture yourself as a missionary</p>
<p>2. Think about the things you need to do to prepare yourself to serve.</p>
<p>3. Have you made the descision yet to go on a mission? Choose NOW to serve a mission.</p>
<p>4. Start making any changes in your life you need to to get prepared now.</p>
<p>5. Tell Bishop that you are planning on going. Ask for his counsel on things that you could do to prepare</p>


<h1>How can I best prepare spiritually to be a missionary?</h1>

<p>Work on strengthening your own understanding and testimony of the gospel by praying daily and studying the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. Attend your Church meetings. Participate in seminary or institute, if available. You may share the gospel with a friend, go to teaching appointments with the full-time missionaries, or ask recently returned missionaries about their experiences in the mission field. You may also become familiar with Preach My Gospel, especially chapters 1 and 3.</p>

<h1 class="pmfont">Are You Prepared to Serve?</h1>

<p>Within two short years, all of the full-time missionaries currently serving in the royal army of God will have concluded their full-time labors and will have returned to their homes and loved ones. Their replacements are found tonight in the ranks of the Aaronic Priesthood of the Church. Young men, are you ready to respond? Are you willing to work? Are you prepared to serve?</p>

<p>President John Taylor summed up the requirements: “The kind of men we want as bearers of this gospel message are men who have faith in God; men who have faith in their religion; men who honor their priesthood; … men full of the Holy Ghost and the power of God[;] … men of honor, integrity, virtue and purity.”</p>
