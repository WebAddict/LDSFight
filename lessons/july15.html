<h1>From Elder Mitchell Christensen</h1>
<h2>Jamaica Kingston Mission</h2>
<h3>Mon, July 11, 2016</h2>

<p class="italic">Young Men of the Allen Ranch Ward,</p>
<p class="italic">I hope the school year went really well for all of you. That time at school isn't the funnest and sometimes not the most rewarding but a mission is. Going through high school i had a lot of doubts. Life is hard you are trying to get good grades to impress your parents than you have that one girl that you are trying to impress at school and on top of that you have athletics. Whoops forgot one, GOD! Can't forget about him. I thought grades, sports and girls were everything. There is more. The Mission has belssed my life so much. I didn't want to come out on a mission during my senior year it was a hard choice i thought i could referee soccer and go to school and i would be fine. But being out here on a mission i could care less about those right now. I don't think i've been happier. We are teaching a woman who is trying to stop smoking Weed. You know how much weed is in jamaica. Where ever you go the temptation is there. She has gone 5 days now not smoking weed. She is repenting! She is Changing and coming closer to God! I couldn't stop smiling when she told us that. I've learned how to get along with everybody even if they are not the same as me or if i wouldn't of been their "friend" at school. I love everybody i come into contact with. We are all brothers and sisters. Young men it is a hard choice to serve but you know what you need to do. I knew what i needed to do. In the book of mormon in 1 Nephi 3:7 What does that say? I will go and do the things which the lord commands me. What ended up happening to him because he was obediant to the commandments of the lord? He didn't die? He got the record! Something that helped me prepare for the mission was reading the book of mormon. Something i would of liked to do more of was study all of Preach my gospel. Everything in there will help you. Read it like a book and also Pray about it. Young men never stop Praying. Sometimes i am so tired at night i fall into bed and i almost forget to pray. When i remember i sleep better. I know that God is our Father. He loves all of us. He needs all of you to come out on a mission. There is somebody out here that needs you. Only you can convert them. They need your help. God needs your help. I know this church is the only true church on the face of the earth. there is over 100 churches here in jamaica. I've been to a few and nothing feels like ours. I love being out on the lords errand and it goes by way fast. I've almost been gone for a year and it has felt like 6 months! Boy oh Boy. Young men big up your self</p>

<h1>From Elder Conner McLeod</h1>
<h2>Guatemala Quetzaltenango Mission</h2>
<h3>Mon, July 11, 2016</h2>

<p class="italic">To the young men,</p>

<p class="italic">I know that serving a mission is a big deal. When someone goes on a mission he has to leave a lot of cool things behind like a job, cars, friends, school, family, girlfrieds=), and just life in general. A lot of important stuff. It was hard for me dont worry, I wont lie and tell you all that it wasnt tough cuz it was, but i want to tell you why I left those things and then decided to permanently leave them behind for 2 years.</p>

<p class="italic">1st thing you have to understand is Gods plan, for you, and for the rest of his children. When I was at home, I literally had blinders on haha I had NO CLUE what Gods plan was whatsoever, I was just constantly focussed on the 7 things I listed in the first sentence of this email, and that was all I knew. There is a lot more to life than just living for yourself. Im saying that there is a lot more to this life, its purpose, its problems, and its sufferings than just what you all see in Gilbert. Before this life, before you were born, you lived with God and your families, your whole families. Before this life you guys made SPECIAL PROMISES to your loved ones, you made a promise that you were going to come down to this world, be born, and search out your loved ones who have gone astray/always been astray, and save them. I want to share a story with you guys-</p>

<p class="italic">A couple years ago here in Guatemala an old, deaf lady of about 70 years was baptized. It was a sweet conversion! She was super spiritual and ready for the gospel, her whole life she had struggled with heavy family losses and problems in life, she had then lost her eyesight due to some harsh illnesses. she had needed the comfort that the gospel brings to our lives for a long time, but luckily a pair of missionaries found her and taught her the gospel, and eventually baptized her.</p>

<p class="italic">The day came when that lady wanted to receive her patriarchal blessing. Since she is bling, the missionaries were given special permission to read it to her after it had been processed in Salt Lake and registered. Her patriarchal blessing was very special, here is what a part of it said.</p>

<p class="italic" style="margin-left: 25px; font-style: italic;">&quot;You are a very special daughter of God. You have struggled with many hardships in your life, you have faced many trials, and your faith has been tried. The gospel of Jesus Christ will bring a new joy to your life that you have never known. You were supposed to receive this gospel when you were just a teenager, but the missionary that had promised to baptize you in the premortal life decided to not serve a mission.&quot;</p>

<p class="italic">What a shocking experience, luckily she received it in this life. But, if only that one lone missionary had just chosen to serve a mission, this lady would have been blessed to have lived her whole life with the gospel of jesus christ to comfort and guide her through her trials.</p>

<p class="italic">I know and bear a strong witness that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU made a very similar promise, not that long ago, and in a place not that far away. There are people suffering and waiting for YOU to bless their lives RIGHT NOW, you just dont know it. I promise you, that if you choose to just temporarily take the blinders of life off, You will see the bigger picture, and you will be able to participate in the incredible joy of saving your loved ones. Nothing compares to seeing someone you loved dressed in white, ready to make covanents with God, it makes you cry (no joke I cry every time).  I invite you all to kneel down tonight and ask your heavenly father if there is someone in this world waiting for you to share the gospel with them. I promise you that he will answer. YOU ARE the angels that DNC 86:5 talks about, you are the chosen and the elect, of God. love you guys, the church is true, Christ lives, and he atoned for your sins, share this message of love, the gospel, with someone YOU love, it literally saves lives.</p>

<p class="italic">Sincerely,</p>

<h1>From Elder Mitchell Robinson</h1>
<h2>México Querétaro Mission</h2>
<h3>Mon, July 11, 2016</h2>


<p class="italic">I love the question of why should they go and I will tell you. The first thing is that the mission has changed my life 100% and for the better. I have learned to trust in the Lord in all that I do, I have learned to love and serve. Another reason is that it brings so much joy. I still remember my very first baptism in the mission after months without much success and that day I felt so much joy and love for the person that I baptised and for the Lord. The things that one does on the mission do not just change lives but it changes eternities. Many times I have had lessons were people look at me with tears in their eyes and they call me an angel because of what I have brought into their lives,and it is an amazing feeling. One thing my mission pres said to us is that God never is and never will be a debter (deudor) and no matter how much we serve him he will always give us much more in return. The mission is not easy but it is more than worth it. I just want all the young men to know that I love the Lord and I know that he has a plan for us that at times we cannot understand. I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of the Lord and he restored the true church of our Savior Jesus Christ here on earth once again. If we do what the Lord asks of us we will be blessed more than we can imagen.</p>

<p class="italic">Con Mucho Amor,</p>
