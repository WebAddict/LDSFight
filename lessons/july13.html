<h1>Discover the joy of family history work and serve others through indexing.</h1>

<p>Imagine yourself living 200 years ago. What would you do for fun? What would you do for work? What would your friends be like? When you view historical records, the names, handwriting, and dates can set your mind imagining what it would be like to live in 1778 or 1801—in the French Countryside, or the city of London.</p>

<h2 class="pmfont">What is Indexing?</h2>

<p>By simply typing what you see on a historical record, you are indexing and making records searchable so others can discover their relatives and take their names to the temple. Each name you transcribe is someone’s ancestor. Each indexed name can then be found by other family members living today.</p>

<p>You have an opportunity to receive these blessings and join with other youth around the world in the upcoming Worldwide Indexing Event. Imagine people all over the world finding a long lost ancestor because of the work of 72,000 people indexing millions of records in 72 hours, July 15 to 17. Learn more at familysearch.org/worldsrecords</p>


<h1>F.I.G.H.T. Challenge!</h1>
<p>We are participating in this Indexing Event! You will index as many records as you can in this event, and you will report your indexing progress on the Newest version of the Lds Fight app (coming by Sat July 16).</p>

<h1>Do I get F.I.G.H.T. Points?</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold;">YES!</span> The FamilySearch indexing software keeps track of the records you index, and assigns you FamilySearch Points. You will report those points on the LDS Fight Goal's page - and in return you will get 3 Fight points for every FamilySearch Indexing Point. We will use any points you have collected from June 1, 2016 to July 31, 2016, not just the 72 hour event.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Index 50 records - you get around 100+ FamilySearch Points - you turn that into 300+ Fight points!</p>

<h1>MINI Challenge</h1>
<p>The TOP INDEXER of our Youth will get $20 CASH! (for ALL of June-July, not just 72 hour event)</p>
<p>Note: You will snap a photo of sreenshot of your FamilySearch Stats page that shows your points awarded per month.</p>

<h1>Trainers Needed!</h1>
<p>Don't be afraid to give up indexing time to help others! Anyone who volunteers to train others to use indexing software will be able to be rewarded 5 points per minute spent training! That means 30 mins training = 150 Fight points!</p>
<p>Let your leaders know you want to be a trainer, and they will contact yout  when someone asks for help</p>

<h1>Is there a limit?</h1>
<p>NOPE! 3 Fight points per 1 Indexing Points earned June-July 2016!</p>

<h1>How do you get started?</h1>
<p>Start by going to <span style="font-size: 115%; font-weight: bold;">familysearch.org/worldsrecords</span> and downloading the software and watchg the videos!</p>
