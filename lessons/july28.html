<p>What an amazing program F.I.G.H.T. has been!! My hope is that we can take what we have learned over the last 2 months and truly apply it to our daily lives moving forward.</p>

<p>School is starting back up, a normal schedule will resume and the F.I.G.H.T. program will become a memory. Will you continue to write in your journal? Read your scriptures daily? Will you attend the temple regularly? I hope the answer to these questions is YES. I know if we do these things our lives will be blessed.</p>

<p>Now, I want to focus just for a moment on rescue. Rescue, as in helping each other out. Can you think of someone in your quorum who could use a personal invitation to mutual or church? Can you think of someone in your quorum who could use a friend? Will you be the person who invites and becomes that friend?</p>

<p>I know that as we strive to do the things that have been asked of us we gain joy and peace in this life. I also know that as we do these things, we gain charity and want to focus on those who may need our help.</p>

<p>You are awesome young men and it has been an amazing summer. I felt the bonds of our young menâ€™s program become stronger as we trusted in God together.</p>

<p>I hope you have a great school year and I hope you always remember to trust in God. Do this and I promise you happiness. Will it be easy? Absolutely not! But you are a son of God and you can do it!</p>
