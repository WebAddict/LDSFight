<h1>From Elder Garrett Gray</h1>
<h2>Massachusetts Boston Mission</h2>
<h3>Mon, July 18, 2016</h2>

<p class="italic">Dear Young Men,</p>

<p>Well, I have a lot of feelings when it comes to serving a full-time mission for the Lord, and so I will try my best to put my feelings into words. Serving a full-time mission is definitely the most difficult thing I have done in my life, but it also has been the most rewarding thing of my life. I have never seen so many blessings, nor so many miracles than on my mission. I have also never relied more on the Lord, begging Him everyday to bless the people that we are teaching and to help us be able to find even more people to teach, than on my mission. I came to know more about and to appreciate more the Atonement of Jesus Christ and His Gospel.</p>

<p>I think that the number one reason that you should go on a mission is because it is the best thing that you can do for your life. Serving a mission, giving yourself up to the Lord for 2 years will be the most rewarding thing you can possibly do in your life because it gives the Lord the opportunity to make you who you ought to be, rather than who you want to be. You will be put in the mission and areas that will best help YOU become who you need to be and the best person you can be. It will allow you to rely more on the Lord and give him your entire will, such that He will take it and make you a thousand times better than what you were before.</p>

<p>Now, here are some thoughts on mission life. Before I came out here, I did not really understand what exactly I was expecting, so here is a basic rundown of what actually happens on a mission.</p>

<p>One day of the week will be your P-day, this is when you will do all the activities that you need to do to prepare for the upcoming week (emailing, laundry, grocery shopping, activities with other missionaries, etc.). The rest of the days are full of activities such as teaching appointments (when you will teach investigators or recent-converts one of the 5 lessons taught in Preach My Gospel chapter 3 and invite them to keep commitments. Investigators are usually really fun to teach, and really awesome people, so be excited for them), dinner appointments (when you will have dinner with a member family and teach them a short message about the gospel), service (providing service in many different environments (farms, soup kitchens, food pantries, etc.), street contacting (walking down big streets in the cities talking to people about the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ), tracting (knocking doors, yes, you will do that sometimes :), etc. The mission mostly focuses on members, because getting members to invite their friends to listen to you is the most successful way to teach repentance and baptize converts.</p>

<p>I think that the best way to prepare is definitely to study Preach My Gospel, especially Chapter 3 since you will be teaching a lesson out of there at least once a day (maybe more, or maybe less depending on the mission), the Book of Mormon, as well as possibly going out with missionaries in the Stake to teaching appointments (you need to be at least 16). I never went out with the missionaries before my mission but a lot of my companions did and they said that it helped them a lot. Going to a missionary preparation course will help a lot as well.</p>

<p>In short, I hope that you all respond to the call to serve and go on missions. It is definitely the best thing that you can do for your life, and is the most rewarding thing you can do for your life. It is not easy, but it's possible, with the Lord's help I know that all of you would be able to go. I hope that this letter finds you all well, and if you have any questions, feel free to shoot them at me!</p>

<p class="italic">Sincerely,</p>
