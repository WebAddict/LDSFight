<p>We have been born, as Nephi of old, To goodly parents who love the Lord. We have been taught, and we understand, That we must do as the Lord commands.</p>
<p>Chorus: We are as the army of Helaman. We have been taught in our youth. And we will be the Lord's missionaries To bring the world his truth.</p>
<p>We have been saved for these latter days To build the kingdom in righteous ways. We hear the words our prophet declares: "Let each who's worthy go forth and share."</p>
<p>We know his plan, and we will prepare, Increase our knowledge through study and prayer. Daily we'll learn until we are called To take the gospel to all the world.</p>
